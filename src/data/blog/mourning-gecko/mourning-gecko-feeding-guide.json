      "content": "Mourning geckos are omnivores that eat fruit and insects in the wild. In captivity, their diet is simplified using commercial crested gecko diet (CGD) as the staple food, supplemented with live insects 1-2x weekly. This combination provides complete nutrition and enrichment. Because all mourning geckos are female and reproduce continuously via parthenogenesis, proper nutrition - especially calcium - is critical for egg production and hatchling health."
