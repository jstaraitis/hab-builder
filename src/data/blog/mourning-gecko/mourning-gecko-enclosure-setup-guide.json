      "content": "Mourning geckos are tiny arboreal lizards native to tropical rainforests across the South Pacific, Central America, and Hawaii. At only 4 inches long, these social geckos require vertical climbing space and MUST be housed in groups. Proper enclosure setup is critical for this species' wellbeing, as they are naturally communal and rely on companions for normal behavior."

Because they are arboreal (tree-dwelling), vertical space is more important than floor space. Height allows them to establish territories at different levels and maximize climbing opportunities."
