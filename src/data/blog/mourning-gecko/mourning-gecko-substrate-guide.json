      "content": "While mourning geckos are arboreal and spend most of their time climbing, substrate plays a critical role in maintaining the 60-80% humidity they require. Substrate also provides cushioning for occasional falls and supports bioactive systems with cleanup crews. Choosing the right substrate ensures proper moisture retention while preventing mold and bacterial growth."

However, the forest floor provides constant moisture through decomposing organic matter and retains humidity throughout the day. In captivity, substrate replicates this moist, organic-rich environment even though the geckos primarily use vertical space."
