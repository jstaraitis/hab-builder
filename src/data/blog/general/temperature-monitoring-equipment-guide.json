A difference of just 5-10°F can mean the difference between healthy digestion and respiratory infection, between active behavior and lethargy. Inaccurate temperature measurement is one of the most common causes of husbandry failures in captive reptiles. This guide covers every type of temperature monitoring equipment, how to use them correctly, and which tools are essential vs optional."
