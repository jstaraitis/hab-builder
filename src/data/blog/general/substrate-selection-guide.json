The right substrate supports natural behaviors like digging, foraging, and thermoregulation. The wrong substrate can cause impaction, respiratory issues, or simply fails to meet your animal's needs. This guide covers substrate types from arid desert mixes to tropical bioactive systems, with DIY recipes and safety guidelines."
