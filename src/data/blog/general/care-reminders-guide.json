      "text": "Keeping reptiles and amphibians healthy requires consistent, species-specific care routines—feeding, misting, temperature adjustments, cleaning, and health checks. But with busy schedules and multiple enclosures, it's easy to lose track of what needs to be done when. Habitat Builder's Smart Care Reminders system makes it easy to stay on top of your animal care with notifications, and a reliability score that tracks how well you're meeting your animals' needs."

When you create a new enclosure in Habitat Builder, the system recommends species-specific care tasks based on the animal's requirements. You can customize the frequency (daily, every 2 days, weekly, etc.) and preferred time of day for each task."
