      "text": "Red-Eyed Tree Frogs (Agalychnis callidryas) are obligate insectivores - their entire diet consists of live (or convincingly presented dead) insects. In the wild, they're opportunistic hunters that consume whatever appropriately-sized prey wanders onto their perch during nighttime foraging: moths, flies, crickets, small beetles, and other soft-bodied invertebrates. Captive nutrition requires replicating this variety while addressing the nutritional deficiencies inherent in commercially-raised feeder insects. Unlike wild insects that feed on diverse plants and accumulate minerals from natural sources, captive-bred feeders are nutritionally incomplete - they lack calcium, essential vitamins, and proper calcium:phosphorus ratios. Without gut-loading (enriching feeders before offering) and dusting (coating with supplements), captive frogs develop metabolic bone disease, vitamin deficiencies, and shortened lifespans."
