      "text": "While meeting temperature, humidity, and feeding requirements keeps Red-Eyed Tree Frogs alive, environmental enrichment is what allows them to THRIVE. These are intelligent, social amphibians with complex behaviors: they climb, explore, hunt, interact with tankmates, breed, and even show individual personalities. A barren enclosure with correct parameters produces stressed, inactive frogs with suppressed natural behaviors. Enrichment - the provision of species-appropriate stimulation - dramatically improves welfare: frogs are more active, display natural behaviors, show better breeding success, have stronger immune systems, and live longer. This guide covers physical habitat complexity, social enrichment, hunting/feeding strategies, breeding support, and how to recognize whether your frogs are truly thriving or merely surviving."
