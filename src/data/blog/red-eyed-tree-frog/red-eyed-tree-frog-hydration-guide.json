      "text": "Red-Eyed Tree Frogs (Agalychnis callidryas) have a fascinating and specialized hydration system that differs dramatically from mammals. They do NOT drink water through their mouths like we do. Instead, they absorb moisture through their highly permeable skin, particularly through a specialized patch on their underside called the 'pelvic patch' or 'drinking patch.' In the wild, they obtain water from multiple sources: morning dew condensing on leaves, rain droplets running down foliage, sitting in shallow water to absorb moisture, and even from humid air through their skin. This semi-aquatic, arboreal lifestyle means captive hydration requires THREE water sources: a soaking pool for submersion, consistent misting for droplets/humidity, and clean water quality to prevent skin absorption of toxins. Understanding this biology is essential - dehydration happens rapidly (within 24-48 hours), and frogs can absorb harmful chemicals through skin just as easily as water."
