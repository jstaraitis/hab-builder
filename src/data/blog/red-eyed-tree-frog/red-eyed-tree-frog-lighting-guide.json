      "text": "Red-Eyed Tree Frogs are primarily crepuscular (dawn/dusk active) and nocturnal, spending daylight hours sleeping on leaf undersides with eyes closed. This lifestyle has led to debate about whether UVB lighting is necessary - after all, they avoid direct sun exposure in the wild. However, research increasingly shows that even shade-dwelling amphibians benefit from low-level UVB exposure filtered through forest canopy. While not 'required' in the strictest sense (captive frogs survive without it), proper UVB lighting improves calcium metabolism, immune function, breeding success, and overall longevity. Additionally, a proper photoperiod (day/night cycle) is essential for regulating circadian rhythms, and strong lighting is mandatory if you want live plants to thrive in your paludarium."
