      "text": "Red-Eyed Tree Frog paludariums require a sophisticated multi-layer substrate system that serves three distinct purposes: providing drainage and biological filtration in the false bottom, supporting live plant growth in the terrestrial zone, and maintaining a clean aquatic environment. Unlike simple terrestrial setups, paludarium substrates must prevent waterlogging while maintaining high moisture levels, support beneficial bacteria colonies for water quality, and create a stable foundation for climbing structures. Poor substrate choices lead to anaerobic soil, root rot, water contamination, and bacterial infections in frogs."
