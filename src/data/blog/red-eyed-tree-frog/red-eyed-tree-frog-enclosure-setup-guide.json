      "text": "Red-Eyed Tree Frogs (Agalychnis callidryas) are semi-aquatic arboreal amphibians that require a specialized enclosure called a paludarium - a habitat combining both substantial water and vertical climbing space. Unlike standard terrariums, paludariums recreate the riparian zones (interfaces between land and water) where these frogs naturally live near ponds and streams in tropical rainforests. The paludarium design supports their dual lifestyle: climbing and sleeping on foliage during the day, then descending to water for hydration, thermoregulation, and breeding at night."
