      "text": "Red-Eyed Tree Frogs (Agalychnis callidryas) come from tropical rainforests where temperature and humidity remain remarkably stable year-round. Their physiology is adapted to this narrow environmental range: daytime temps of 75-85°F (24-29°C), nighttime slight drop to 68-75°F (20-24°C), and average humidity of 70-75% with brief morning/evening peaks to 90% from rain/fog. Unlike some hardy species that tolerate wide fluctuations, Red-Eyed Tree Frogs are INTOLERANT of temperature extremes or prolonged low humidity. Overheating causes fatal metabolic stress within hours, while chronic low humidity leads to dehydration, failed sheds, and respiratory infections. Their highly permeable skin makes them especially vulnerable - they absorb moisture and regulate temperature through skin contact, not just respiration."
