In captivity, they thrive on specially-formulated crested gecko diet (CGD) powder supplemented with live feeder insects. CGD is a nutritionally-complete meal replacement that becomes a smoothie when mixed with water, eliminating the need for complex fruit preparation. This guide covers evidence-based feeding protocols for optimal crested gecko health."
