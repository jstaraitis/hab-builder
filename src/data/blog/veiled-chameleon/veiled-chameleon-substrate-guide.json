The intensive misting schedule (3x daily) and overnight fogging produce 1-2 GALLONS of water daily that must drain continuously to prevent waterlogging, mold growth, and bacterial contamination. This guide covers drainage system options (bare-bottom, elevated platforms, bioactive with drainage layers), why traditional substrate fails, flooring materials, bioactive setup modifications, and preventing water-related health issues. Most keepers use bare-bottom or elevated drainage systems; bioactive is possible but requires significant additional complexity for proper drainage."

Chameleon inhales contaminated air = severe respiratory infection (pneumonia) often fatal. Substrate saturation also creates extreme humidity (100% constantly) preventing proper humidity cycling (should be 40-50% day, 80-100% night only).

It's unsexy, not Instagram-worthy, but utterly functional and low-maintenance. Bioactive looks incredible but requires expert-level commitment. Choose based on YOUR situation (time, budget, skill, housing flexibility) not idealized Pinterest images. Chameleon's health is identical in bare-bottom vs bioactive - difference is purely keeper preference."

        " <span class='font-semibold'>Drainage hole:</span> 1-2 inch hole in enclosure floor (lowest corner) OR entire substrate tray/bioactive system with outflow. Water must EXIT enclosure continuously",
        " <span class='font-semibold'>Collection method:</span> Bucket positioned under drain hole (3-5 gallon capacity) OR plumbed PVC to sink/drain. Verified water flowing to collection point",
        " <span class='font-semibold'>Daily drainage:</span> Collection bucket/tray emptied daily (bare-bottom or substrate tray) OR plumbed drain flowing freely 24/7 (bioactive)",
