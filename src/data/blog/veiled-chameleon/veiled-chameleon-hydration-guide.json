Unlike many reptiles, chameleons do NOT drink from standing water dishes - they lick water droplets from foliage and enclosure surfaces. ReptiFiles and Chameleon Academy recommend specific hydration protocol: misting 3x daily (1:30 AM, 6 AM, 9 PM), fogger running 4.5 hours overnight (1:30-6 AM), and optional dripper mid-afternoon (3-5 PM). This guide covers complete hydration system setup, drinking behavior recognition, water quality requirements, dehydration assessment, and troubleshooting common issues."

Monitor urate color (white/cream good, yellow/orange concern). Clean fogger weekly - contaminated foggers cause respiratory infections. Proper hydration = white urates, plump eyes, smooth skin."
