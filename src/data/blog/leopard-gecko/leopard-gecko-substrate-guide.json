      "content": "Substrate for leopard geckos is one of the most debated topics in reptile keeping. For decades, keepers were told to avoid any loose substrate due to impaction fears. However, modern research and field observations show that healthy leopard geckos on appropriate substrates, with proper heating and hydration, do not experience impaction. This guide covers evidence-based substrate choices that balance safety, enrichment, and naturalistic habitat design."
