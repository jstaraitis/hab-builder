      "content": "Leopard geckos are crepuscular (most active at dawn and dusk) with adaptations for low-light conditions. For years, they were kept without UVB lighting, relying on dietary vitamin D3 supplementation. However, modern research shows that leopard geckos benefit significantly from low-level UVB exposure, demonstrating improved bone density, appetite, and natural behaviors. This guide covers evidence-based lighting practices, including special considerations for albino and low-pigment morphs."
