      "content": "Leopard geckos are desert-adapted reptiles from the arid regions of South Asia, where daytime temperatures reach 90-100×F and humidity stays low (20-40%) except in underground burrows. Unlike tropical species, they require hot basking zones, significant temperature drops at night, and low ambient humidity with access to localized high-humidity retreats. This guide covers how to create and maintain appropriate desert climate conditions."
