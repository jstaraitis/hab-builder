      "content": "Leopard geckos originate from semi-arid regions of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal, where water sources are seasonal and limited. Despite their desert origins, they require consistent access to fresh water and periodic high-humidity microclimates (humid hides) for proper shedding. Their hydration needs differ dramatically from tropical species×they don't require misting or high ambient humidity, but they do need strategic humidity zones and reliable water sources. This guide covers evidence-based hydration practices including water dish placement, humid hide construction, dehydration recognition, and troubleshooting stuck sheds."
