      "content": "Leopard geckos are obligate insectivores, requiring a diet of live, moving insects to trigger hunting behaviors and provide complete nutrition. Unlike crested geckos, they cannot survive on prepared powdered diets—they must eat whole insects. Proper feeding encompasses more than just offering bugs: it requires age-appropriate schedules, calcium supplementation to prevent metabolic bone disease, gut-loading feeder insects for optimal nutrition, and portion control to maintain healthy body condition. This guide provides evidence-based feeding protocols for all life stages."
