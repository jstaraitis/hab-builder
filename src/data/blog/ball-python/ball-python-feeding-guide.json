      "content": "Ball pythons are obligate carnivores, requiring a diet of whole animal prey to obtain complete nutrition. Unlike some reptiles that can survive on single prey types, ball pythons thrive on dietary variety—rats, mice, African soft-furred rats, quail, and chicks all contribute unique nutritional profiles. Modern ball python nutrition emphasizes the '10% body weight rule' for portion sizing, age-based feeding frequencies (ranging from every 5 days for hatchlings to every 4-8 weeks for large adults), and frozen-thawed prey for safety and humaneness. This ReptiFiles®-based guide covers feeding schedules, prey selection, troubleshooting picky eaters, and avoiding common feeding mistakes that lead to obesity or nutritional deficiencies."
