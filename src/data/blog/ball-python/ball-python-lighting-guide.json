      "content": "Ball pythons are predominantly nocturnal constrictors, most active during dawn and dusk when light levels are low, though they are also active semi-arboreal hunters. For decades, conventional wisdom claimed ball pythons don't need or benefit from light, leading to common practices of keeping them in dark tubs with no lighting. Recent research suggests ball pythons can benefit from UVB lighting and natural day/night cycles, though they have been successfully kept without UVB for generations using dietary vitamin D3. This guide covers UVB provision as an optional enhancement (2.0-3.0 UVI if provided), photoperiod management for day/night cycles, and the debate around UVB necessity for ball pythons."
