      "content": "Ball pythons (Python regius), also known as royal pythons, are terrestrial constrictors native to western and central Africa's semi-arid grasslands and forests. Despite outdated claims that ball pythons prefer cramped spaces, modern research confirms they thrive in larger enclosures that allow proper thermoregulation, exercise, and natural behaviors including climbing. This guide provides evidence-based housing recommendations from ReptiFiles®, covering the 120-gallon (48×24×24 inches) minimum enclosure standard, horizontal thermal gradient setup, essential hide requirements, and environmental enrichment for these crepuscular hunters."
