      "content": "Ball pythons originate from semi-arid to sub-tropical regions of western and central Africa, where they inhabit grasslands, agricultural areas, and forest edges. These environments feature packed earth with seasonal moisture fluctuations—dry during the dry season, humid during monsoons. Captive substrate must replicate this by retaining moderate to high humidity (45-75%) while providing a naturalistic surface. This guide covers soil-based substrate options recommended by ReptiFiles®, including commercial products, DIY mixes, proper depth guidelines, and maintenance schedules to support healthy shedding and respiratory function in ball pythons."
