      "content": "Ball pythons originate from semi-arid West African savannas with seasonal rainfall, requiring moderate to high hydration (70-80% humidity ideal). Proper hydration depends on three factors: accessible water bowl (large enough for full-body soaking), adequate ambient humidity, and appropriate temperatures for metabolic hydration. Dehydration manifests through sunken eyes, wrinkled skin, and stuck sheds—all preventable with correct husbandry. This guide covers water bowl setup, recognizing dehydration, supporting healthy sheds (every 4-8 weeks for adults), troubleshooting stuck sheds, and understanding the humidity-hydration relationship critical for captive ball python health."
