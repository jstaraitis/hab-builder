      "content": "Ball pythons originate from semi-arid West African savannas with seasonal rainfall, requiring moderate hydration (45-75% humidity) rather than tropical levels. Proper hydration depends on three factors: accessible water bowl (large enough for full-body soaking), adequate ambient humidity (measured in cool hide), and appropriate temperatures for metabolic hydration (95-104°F basking). Dehydration manifests through sunken eyes, wrinkled skin, and stuck sheds—all preventable with correct husbandry. This ReptiFiles®-based guide covers water bowl setup, recognizing dehydration, supporting healthy sheds (every 4-8 weeks for adults), troubleshooting stuck sheds, and understanding the humidity-hydration relationship critical for captive ball python health."
