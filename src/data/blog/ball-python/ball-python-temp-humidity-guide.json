      "content": "Ball pythons are ectothermic (cold-blooded) constrictors from western and central Africa's semi-arid to subtropical regions, where they experience warm days (85-95°F ambient), moderate nights, and humidity ranging 50-70% with seasonal variation. As ectotherms, they cannot internally regulate body temperature—they must move between thermal zones to warm up for digestion, cool down to prevent overheating, and seek humid microclimates for shedding. This guide covers proper temperature gradients (88-92°F warm side, 76-80°F cool side), heating equipment selection, humidity management (70-80% ideal), and troubleshooting for optimal ball python health."
