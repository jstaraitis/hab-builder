      "content": "Corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus) are crepuscular constrictors, most active during dawn and dusk when light levels transition. For decades, conventional wisdom claimed corn snakes don't need or even benefit from lighting, leading to common husbandry practices of keeping them in dark racks with no lighting whatsoever. Modern research has debunked this myth: corn snakes benefit significantly from UVB lighting and natural day/night cycles. Studies show improved bone density, better appetite, enhanced immune function, and more natural behaviors in UVB-exposed corn snakes."
