      "title": "Complete Carnivore Diet for Corn Snakes",
      "content": "Corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus) are obligate carnivores, requiring a diet of whole animal prey to obtain complete nutrition. Unlike some snake species that thrive on single prey types, corn snakes benefit significantly from dietary variety—mice, young rats, quail, quail eggs, chicks, and green anoles all contribute unique nutritional profiles. Modern corn snake nutrition emphasizes the '10% body weight rule' for portion sizing (prey items totaling 10% of snake's weight), age-based feeding frequencies (ranging from every 7-10 days for hatchlings to every 14-21 days for adults), and frozen-thawed prey for safety and humaneness. This ReptiFiles®-based guide covers feeding schedules, prey selection, troubleshooting picky eaters, and avoiding common feeding mistakes that lead to obesity or nutritional deficiencies."
