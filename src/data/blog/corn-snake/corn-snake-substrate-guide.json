Soil-based substrates (Zoo Med ReptiSoil, Lugarti Natural Reptile Bedding, coconut fiber, or DIY 40% topsoil + 40% coco coir + 20% play sand) provide optimal moisture retention, safe burrowing substrate, and bioactive compatibility. Depth matters×3-4 inches minimum allows humidity buffering and slight burrowing while supporting beneficial microfauna in bioactive setups."
