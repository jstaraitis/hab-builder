      "title": "120 Gallon Semi-Arboreal Housing for Corn Snakes",
      "content": "Corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus) are active, semi-arboreal crepuscular snakes native to the southeastern United States requiring spacious enclosures that accommodate both ground movement and climbing behavior. Despite outdated recommendations of 20-40 gallon enclosures, modern reptile husbandry standards recommend 120 gallons (48×24×24 inches) minimum based on the formula: snake length × half snake length × half snake length = enclosure dimensions. These 3-5 foot snakes thrive with horizontal thermal gradients (90°F basking surface → 75°F cool zone), multiple climbing structures, both warm and cool hides, and environmental enrichment. This ReptiFiles®-based guide covers enclosure sizing, material comparisons (PVC vs glass), thermal zone requirements, hide and enrichment placement, cohabitation dangers, and complete equipment checklists for optimal corn snake housing."
