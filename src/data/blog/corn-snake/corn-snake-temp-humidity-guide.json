      "content": "Corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus) are ectothermic crepuscular constrictors from the southeastern United States, where they inhabit pine forests, hardwood forests, abandoned buildings, and agricultural areas with moderate humidity (60-80%) and warm seasonal temperatures. As crepuscular species, corn snakes are most active at dawn and dusk, using thermal gradients to regulate body temperature for digestion, activity, and shedding. This guide covers ReptiFiles®-recommended temperature zones, heating equipment selection (halogen bulbs as primary heat, NOT heat mats), humidity management with daily misting, and troubleshooting for optimal corn snake health."
