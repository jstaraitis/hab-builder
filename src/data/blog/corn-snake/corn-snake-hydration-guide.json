      "content": "Corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus) require consistent access to clean water for drinking, soaking, and thermoregulation. Unlike some desert reptiles that obtain most moisture from prey, corn snakes from southeastern US forests actively drink water and benefit from humidity levels that support healthy shedding cycles. Proper hydration involves three components: a large water bowl for drinking/soaking (snake should be able to curl up inside), humidity management (65-75% average with higher levels during shedding), and recognition of dehydration signs (sunken eyes, wrinkled skin, stuck sheds). This ReptiFiles®-based guide covers water bowl selection, shedding cycle support, dehydration prevention, and stuck shed treatment protocols for optimal corn snake health."
