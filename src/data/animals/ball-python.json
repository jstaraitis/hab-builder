    "PVC front-opening enclosures are ideal - hold humidity better than glass, easier access than top-opening",

    "BOTH warm hide (under basking) AND cool hide (opposite end) are mandatory - not optional",
    "Large water bowl (8-10 inch diameter) on cool side for soaking",
    "Provide climbing enrichment - cork bark, branches, ledges (debunks 'terrestrial only' myth)",
    "Basking surface temp (95-104°F) is CRITICAL for digestion - measure with infrared thermometer, not ambient air temp"

  "notes": [
    "Crepuscular (active dawn/dusk) - NOT nocturnal as commonly believed",
    "Very docile and handleable - rarely bite unless extremely stressed",
    "Known for defensive curling into a ball when stressed (name origin)",
    "Can be picky eaters and may fast seasonally (normal behavior - ball pythons fast 3-6 months safely if healthy weight)",
