  "setupTips": [
    "PVC or wood enclosures hold humidity better than glass tanks with screen tops",
    "Multiple heating options work: UTHs, CHEs, DHPs, RHPs, or halogen flood lights - use thermostat with any heat source",
    "Soil-based substrate (coconut husk, cypress mulch, organic topsoil, or ReptiSoil) holds humidity best - avoid aspen",
    "Minimum of two hides required: one warm side, one cool side - identical hides preferred so snake doesn't prioritize security over temperature",
    "Water bowl must be large enough for full-body soaking",
    "Provide climbing opportunities - ball pythons are active semi-arboreal hunters in the wild and will utilize vertical space",
    "Use thermostat to regulate all heat sources - unregulated UTH can reach 120°F+ and cause severe burns"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Over 6500 morphs available - huge variety in colors/patterns",
    "Named 'ball python' because they curl into tight defensive ball with head protected in center when threatened - 'royal python' name comes from African rulers wearing them as jewelry",
    "Wild ball pythons are specialist predators of African soft-furred rats (Praomys) - this prey preference explains their notorious 'picky eating' in captivity",
    "Females provide parental care - coil around eggs for 55-60 days, shivering to generate heat and rotating eggs to maintain even temperature (one of few snake species showing maternal behavior)",
    "Can sense infrared radiation through heat-sensitive pits along jaw - allows hunting in complete darkness by 'seeing' the body heat of prey"

      "Adults: up to 5% body weight every 20-30 days, OR slightly larger meals (up to 6%) every 30-40 days",
      "Body at healthy weight: softly rounded triangular shape, clearly defined neck, smooth taper from body to tail, feels muscular and strong",
      "If body is more round than triangular: reduce prey weight and/or space out feedings more",

    "mistingNotes": [
      "Target humidity: 70-80% for optimal health (60% minimum, but some individuals may show dehydration at this level)",
      "Primary humidity method: Pour 1-2 quarts of water directly into deep substrate (2-4 inches) for gradual evaporation - more effective than surface misting",
      "Surface misting evaporates quickly causing humidity spikes that drop within hours - saturating substrate provides stable humidity",
      "Keep hide areas dry to avoid scale rot while maintaining overall humidity",
      "If struggling with humidity: reduce screen ventilation, use water-friendly substrate (coconut husk, cypress mulch, ReptiSoil), provide large water dish",
      "Avoid foggers/misters that create constantly wet environment - can cause scale rot"
