    "Mist enclosure morning and evening with tap water (contains essential minerals) - avoid distilled water",
    "Place basking area as a vine, branch, or foliage cluster directly under heat lamp at top of enclosure",
    "Provide vines, branches, and foliage at all vertical levels to allow proper thermoregulation",
    "Use feeding ledges mounted at various heights for easy access to food bowls"
