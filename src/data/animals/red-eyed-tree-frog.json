    "Vertical paludarium setup required - height more important than floor space",
    "Semi-aquatic species - MUST have both land and water sections (not optional)",
    "Best kept in groups of 4-8 for natural social behavior and breeding displays",
    "Provide extensive climbing space with branches, cork, vines positioned diagonally",
    "Dense foliage with sturdy leaves required for resting/hiding during day",
    "Create riparian zone (land-water interface) with easy access points",
    "Use Bio Drain substrate with mesh, topped with Sub Stratum + Plantation Soil + forest moss"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Breeding ratio: 2 males per 1 female encourages healthy competition",
    "Excellent for paludarium builds - naturally humid environment supports live plants",
    "30+ years of successful captive breeding - readily available captive-bred specimens",
    "Uses 'startle coloration' defense - when threatened, flashes bright blue/yellow side coloring and red eyes to shock predators",
    "Tadpoles can hatch early if they detect vibrations from predators (snakes/wasps) - survival adaptation allowing escape before being eaten"
