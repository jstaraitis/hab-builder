    "Huge variety of colors and patterns due to extensive selective breeding",

    "'Crests' (fringed ridges) run from eyes to tail - evolutionary purpose unknown but possibly for water channeling, communication, or making profile appear larger to predators",

    "waterNotes": [
      "Provide shallow water dish (2-3 inches diameter) at all times in cool zone",
      "Crested geckos are 'droplet drinkers' - they prefer licking water droplets from leaves after misting",
      "Mist enclosure 1-2x daily (evening preferred) to provide drinking droplets",
      "Change water dish daily to prevent bacterial growth"
    ],
    "mistingNotes": [
      "Mist once in evening (after lights out) or twice daily (morning + evening)",
      "Target humidity: 60-80% ambient, allow to dry to 60% before next misting",
      "Misting schedule: Light misting for 10-15 seconds until droplets form on leaves",
      "Bioactive setups may require less frequent misting due to substrate moisture retention",
      "During shedding: Increase misting frequency to maintain 70-80% humidity"
