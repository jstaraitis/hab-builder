      "Omnivorous - primary diet is commercial crested gecko diet (CGD powder mixed with water)",

      "Live insects (crickets, dubia roaches) offered 1-2x weekly for enrichment and protein",
      "Insects must be appropriately sized (no wider than space between gecko's eyes)",
      "Dust insects with calcium supplement (Repashy Calcium Plus or similar)",

    "waterNotes": [
      "Provide shallow water dish (2-3 inches diameter) at all times in cool zone",
      "Crested geckos are 'droplet drinkers' - they prefer licking water droplets from leaves after misting",

      "Change water dish daily to prevent bacterial growth"
    ],
    "mistingNotes": [
      "Mist once in evening (after lights out) or twice daily (morning + evening)",
      "Target humidity: 60-80% ambient, allow to dry to 60% before next misting",
      "Misting schedule: Light misting for 10-15 seconds until droplets form on leaves",
      "Bioactive setups may require less frequent misting due to substrate moisture retention",
      "During shedding: Increase misting frequency to maintain 70-80% humidity"
