    "Substrate: DIY arid mix (40% topsoil, 40% sand, 20% excavator clay) allows natural digging",
    "Humid hide placement: Warm side or center, filled with damp sphagnum moss",
    "UVB lighting recommended: Zoo Med ReptiSun 5.0 or Arcadia ShadeDweller for normal morphs"

  "notes": [
    "70+ designer morphs available: albino varieties require reduced UVB (0.5-0.7 UVI) to prevent eye damage",
    "One of few gecko species with movable eyelids - can blink and close eyes for sleep (most geckos have fused eyelids)",
    "Store fat reserves in their tail - thick, plump tail indicates healthy gecko, while thin tail signals malnutrition or illness",
    "Can drop tail when grabbed (autotomy) and regrow it - regenerated tail is shorter, stubbier, and lacks original pattern (stored fat still functional)",
    "Originated 50+ million years ago in arid regions - among the oldest gecko lineages, predating most modern reptile families"

      "Sub-adults (8-12 months): Every 2-3 days, 2 insects per inch or until satiated",
      "Adults (12+ months): Every 3-4 days, 2 insects per inch OR 6-10 insects per feeding",

      "Target humid hide humidity: 70-80% inside hide (measured with small hygrometer)",
      "Placement: Warm side (85-90°F) or center of enclosure for easy access",
      "Maintenance: Re-moisten moss daily with spray bottle, full substrate replacement weekly to prevent mold"
