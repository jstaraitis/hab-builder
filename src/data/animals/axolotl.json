    "Tank MUST be fully cycled before adding axolotl - cycling takes 4-6 weeks minimum",
    "Length and width more important than height - they're bottom-dwelling aquatic animals",
    "Use low-flow filters only - high water flow causes stress (they evolved in still water)",
    "Temperature is CRITICAL - never exceed 72°F or axolotl can die. Use aquarium chiller if room temperature is warm",
    "Fine sand substrate only for axolotls 6+ inches. NO gravel, rocks, or marbles (causes impaction)",
    "Bare-bottom tanks or slate tile are safest substrate options",
    "NO eyelids - provide dark hiding spots to escape bright light",
    "Aquarium lid essential - axolotls can jump out of tank",
    "Test water weekly with liquid test kit.",
    "Perform 20-30% water changes weekly with cold, conditioned water"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Fully aquatic - never leaves water (neotenic salamander that retains juvenile features for life)",
    "Bottom-dwelling with poor eyesight - uses powerful sensory organs to detect movement",
    "Critically Endangered in wild - only found in Lake Xochimilco, Mexico",
    "Can regenerate lost limbs, gills, tail, and even parts of brain and heart",
    "NO eyelids - evolved in darkness, need hiding spots to escape light",
    "Sensitive to water quality - ammonia and nitrites must be 0 ppm at all times",
    "Cold-water species - cannot tolerate warm temperatures (72°F+ can be fatal)",
    "Solitary animals that don't require companionship - best kept alone",
    "Juveniles under 6 inches should NEVER have substrate (impaction risk too high)",
    "Adults 6+ inches can have extremely fine sand only - still risky",
    "Produces significant waste - requires strong filtration and weekly water changes"

    "feedingRequirements": [
      "Obligate carnivores - require whole prey items (worms, small fish, insects)",
      "Food must be small enough to fit in mouth without choking",
      "Axolotls inhale prey using suction feeding - don't chew",
      "NEVER feed mealworms - tough exoskeleton causes impaction"
    ],
    "feedingSchedule": [
      "Adults (8+ inches): Feed once every 2-3 days, as much as they'll eat in 10-15 minutes",
      "Juveniles (under 8 inches): Feed daily, as much as they'll eat in 10-15 minutes",
      "Remove uneaten food after 30 minutes to prevent water quality degradation",
      "Variety is important - rotate between different staple foods"
    ],
    "feedingVariety": [
      "STAPLES: Earthworms/nightcrawlers (4+ inches), blackworms (under 4 inches), frozen silversides, frozen brine shrimp cubes, Repashy Grub Pie",
      "OCCASIONAL (1-2× monthly): Waxworms, hornworms (horn removed), crickets, bloodworms",
      "AVOID: Mealworms (tough exoskeleton), goldfish (high in thiaminase), any food larger than space between eyes"
    ],
    "supplementSchedule": [
      "No supplementation required - whole prey items provide complete nutrition",
      "Earthworms and frozen fish contain all necessary vitamins and minerals",
      "Do NOT use calcium powder or vitamin supplements designed for reptiles"
    ],
    "waterNotes": [
      "Fully aquatic - entire tank is their water feature",
      "Water temperature: 60-68°F ideal, never exceed 72°F",
      "pH: 7.4-7.6 ideal (6.5-8.0 acceptable)",
      "Ammonia: 0 ppm (CRITICAL)",
      "Nitrites: 0 ppm (CRITICAL)",
      "Nitrates: 5-20 ppm (under 40 ppm acceptable)",
      "Use liquid test kit weekly",
      "20-30% water changes weekly with cold, conditioned water",
      "Never use conditioners with aloe vera or plant extracts"
    ],
    "handlingNotes": [
      "Minimize handling - causes extreme stress and damages protective slime coat",
      "Use fine mesh net for transfers (never hands)",
      "If handling unavoidable: wet hands thoroughly, support entire body, minimize time out of water",
      "Never lift by tail, gills, or limbs",
      "Return to water immediately if axolotl struggles or gasps"
    ],
    "substrateOptions": [
      "SAFEST: Bare-bottom tank (easiest to clean, no impaction risk)",
      "SAFE: Slate tile (natural look, no impaction risk, easy to clean)",
      "RISKY: Extremely fine sand (pool filter sand or play sand) - ONLY for axolotls 6+ inches",
      "NEVER USE: Gravel, rocks, marbles, glass stones, coarse sand, artificially colored sand"
    ],
    "commonIssues": [
      "Floating: Gulped too much air during feeding. Usually self-resolves in 24 hours. If persistent, check water quality.",
      "Curled gills: Poor water quality (ammonia/nitrites present) or temperature too warm. Test water immediately.",
      "Loss of appetite: Stress from acclimation (normal 2-3 days), water too warm, poor water quality, or illness.",
      "Frantic swimming: Water quality issue (ammonia/nitrites spike), temperature spike, or extreme stress. Test water and lower temperature.",
      "Fungus on gills/body: Use Indian almond leaves for mild cases, black tea bath for moderate, methylene blue for severe. Always address underlying water quality issue."
    ],
    "tankMateCompatibility": [
      "BEST ALONE: Axolotls are solitary and thrive when housed individually",
      "Multiple axolotls: Possible in 40+ gallon tanks with 2-3 adults maximum. Monitor for aggression and nipping.",
      "Bladder/pond snails: Safe for axolotls 4+ inches. Help clean tank.",
      "NEVER: Fish (nip gills/limbs), shrimp/crayfish (attack with claws), mystery/apple snails under 2 inches (impaction risk)"
    ],
    "cyclingRequirements": [
      "Tank MUST be cycled before axolotl introduction - non-negotiable",
      "Cycling establishes beneficial bacteria to process ammonia → nitrites → nitrates",
      "Process takes 4-6 weeks minimum - cannot be rushed",
      "Use fishless cycling method: add ammonia source, test daily, wait for bacteria colony",
      "Cycle is complete when: Ammonia and nitrites stay at 0 ppm after adding ammonia",
      "Never add axolotl to uncycled tank - causes fatal ammonia poisoning"
