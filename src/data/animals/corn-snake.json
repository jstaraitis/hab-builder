    "PVC front-opening enclosures ideal - hold humidity better than glass, easier access",

    "Soil-based substrate (ReptiSoil, DIY 40/40/20 mix) 3-4 inches deep for humidity retention",
    "BOTH warm hide (under basking) AND cool hide (opposite end) are mandatory",
    "Provide 3-4 sturdy climbing branches at different heights - corn snakes are semi-arboreal",
    "Large water bowl (8-10 inch diameter) on cool side for soaking",
    "Basking surface temp (90°F) measured with infrared thermometer, NOT ambient air temp"

  "notes": [
    "Crepuscular (most active at sunset/dawn) - NOT fully nocturnal as commonly believed",

    "Expert escape artists - secure locking lids essential (can push through weak screen tops)",
    "Adult size: 3-5 feet (males smaller 3-4 feet, females larger 4-5 feet)",
