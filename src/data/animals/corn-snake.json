    "BOTH warm hide (under basking) AND cool hide (opposite end) are mandatory",
    "Provide 3-4 sturdy climbing branches at different heights - corn snakes are semi-arboreal",
    "Large water bowl (8-10 inch diameter) on cool side for soaking",
    "Basking surface temp (90°F) measured with infrared thermometer, NOT ambient air temp"

  "notes": [
    "Over 800 morphs available due to extensive captive breeding",
    "Name originates from frequent presence in cornfields (barns) where they hunt rodents - historically valued by farmers for natural pest control",
    "Excellent climbers and swimmers despite being often labeled 'terrestrial' - wild corn snakes commonly found in trees hunting birds and raiding nests",
    "Can detect chemical trails through tongue-flicking - Jacobson's organ analyzes scent particles to track prey for hours across complex terrain",
    "Natural intergrades with Great Plains rat snakes create 'jungle corns' and other regional variants - shows evolutionary adaptation to different habitats across their range"
