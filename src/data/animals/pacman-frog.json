    "All water must be treated with reptile/amphibian dechlorinator (chlorine causes toxic shock)",
    "C. cranwelli require sandy substrate: 60% organic topsoil + 40% play sand to replicate Gran Chaco habitat",
    "Leaf litter on substrate surface is critical - prevents substrate ingestion, provides CUC habitat",
    "Modified bin enclosures acceptable for quarantine/grow-out but CANNOT be used with UVB (plastic creates toxins)",
    "Substrate must be moist but not waterlogged - squeeze test: water should drip out but no puddles"

  "notes": [
    "Named 'Pacman' frogs due to round body shape and large mouth resembling the classic video game character",
    "'Horns' above eyes are actually bony projections - help camouflage as leaf litter when buried and may protect eyes from struggling prey",
    "Possess odontoid projections (tooth-like structures on upper jaw) - not true teeth but create vice-grip preventing prey escape once bitten",
    "Can consume prey up to 70% of their own body size - documented eating mice, small birds, other frogs, and even attempting to eat items larger than themselves",
    "Enter estivation (underground dormancy) during dry season - create waterproof cocoon of shed skin layers and can survive buried without food for 6-12 months"
