    "Maximize vertical climbing space with vines, branches, and foliage at all levels",
    "Use magnetic feeding ledges for crested gecko diet placement",
    "Keep basking area low (80-85°F) - use 25w bulb with dimmer to fine-tune",
    "Add layer of leaf litter over substrate for naturalistic appearance and foraging enrichment"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "ALL mourning geckos are female - reproduce via parthenogenesis (no males exist)",
    "Offspring are genetic clones of their mother",
    "Males were documented once in 1960s Vietnam - so rare they're considered extinct, making mourning geckos only known self-sustaining all-female vertebrate species",
    "'Mourning' name comes from soft chirping vocalizations that sound like mournful crying - used for territory defense and social communication",
    "Climb on glass/smooth surfaces using microscopic hair-like setae (500,000 per foot) - each hair creates weak molecular attraction allowing vertical climbing"

    "feedingRequirements": [
      "Omnivorous - primary diet is commercial crested gecko diet (CGD powder mixed with water)",
      "Best CGD brands: Pangea, Repashy, Black Panther Zoological, Gecko Pro, Leapin' Leachie, Zoo Med",
      "Live insects offered 1-2x weekly for enrichment and protein diversity",
      "Best insects: crickets, dubia roaches, red runner roaches, darkling beetles, snails, grasshoppers",
      "Insects must be appropriately sized (no larger than space between gecko's eyes)",
      "Dust insects with calcium supplement without D3 (Arcadia CalciumPro Mg, MinerAll Outdoor, or Repashy SuperCal NoD)",
      "Skipping one CGD feeding per week is not harmful and may be beneficial"
    ],
    "feedingSchedule": [
      "Provide crested gecko diet (CGD) continuously - replace every 24-48 hours",
      "Offer calcium-dusted insects 1-2x per week for variety",
      "Remove uneaten insects after feeding session to prevent stress",
      "Skip one CGD feeding per week if desired (natural fasting period)",
      "Breeding females may eat more frequently - monitor body condition"
    ],
    "waterNotes": [
      "Do NOT provide standing water dish (drowning risk for tiny geckos)",
      "Primary hydration from misting - lick water droplets from leaves and surfaces",
      "Mist enclosure every morning and evening with pump-style pressure sprayer",
      "Use tap or spring water (NOT distilled/RO water) to provide essential minerals"
    ],
    "mistingNotes": [
      "Mist twice daily - morning and evening (essential for hydration)",
      "Target humidity: 60-80% ambient throughout day",
      "Humidity naturally rises at night and falls during day (this is healthy)",
      "Humidity should be lower near basking area, higher in cool zone",
      "Use pump-style pressure sprayer for fine mist coverage",
      "Ensure adequate ventilation between mistings to prevent mold growth"
    ],
    "substrateRecommendations": [
      "Use moisture-retentive naturalistic substrate (2-4 inches deep)",
      "Best options: DIY tropical mix (60% organic topsoil + 40% coconut fiber), Lugarti Natural Reptile Bedding, Zoo Med Reptisoil, The Bio Dude Terra Fauna",
      "Add generous layer of leaf litter on top for naturalistic appearance",
      "Substrate helps stabilize humidity and cushions falls from climbing",
      "Spot clean feces/urates daily, scoop contaminated substrate as needed",
      "Complete substrate replacement every 1-3 months (or go bioactive for less maintenance)"
    ],
    "handlingGuidance": [
      "DO NOT HANDLE - mourning geckos are too small (4 inches) and flighty",
      "Handling causes extreme stress and injury risk",
      "These are display/observation animals, not interactive pets",
      "Enjoy watching natural behaviors instead of hands-on interaction",
      "If you need to move a gecko, gently guide into small container rather than grabbing"
