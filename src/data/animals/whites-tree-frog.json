  "setupTips": [
    "White's Tree Frogs prefer horizontal perches and branches over vertical climbing - position sturdy branches at various heights",
    "These frogs are social and docile - can be kept in groups if space allows (30 gallons base + 10 per additional frog)",
    "Provide thick leaf litter layer to protect sensitive skin and create natural foraging environment",
    "Place hides and perches in the upper third of enclosure where they feel most secure",
    "Avoid moss substrates - they retain too much moisture and can cause bacterial growth or impaction if ingested",
    "Use glass or PVC enclosures with mesh top ONLY - screen sides cannot maintain proper warmth for these semi-arid frogs"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Known for their docile temperament and 'smiling' appearance",
    "Males vocalize loudly during breeding season (Nov-Feb in wild) - calls intensify after rain",
    "Waxy skin secretions allow them to tolerate surprisingly arid conditions - can reduce water loss by 95% compared to other frogs",
    "Indigenous Australian names include 'dumpy tree frog' and 'green tree frog' - first scientifically described in 1790 by Dr. John White (ship's surgeon on the First Fleet)",
    "Can change color from bright green to dark brown depending on temperature, mood, and background - darker colors when cold or stressed"
