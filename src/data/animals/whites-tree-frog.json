    "Known for their docile temperament and 'smiling' appearance",
    "Nocturnal and crepuscular - active during dawn/dusk and throughout the night; rest in cool dark spots during day",
    "Can become obese in captivity - monitor feeding carefully and provide dietary variety",
    "Prefer horizontal perches over vertical climbing; rest on leaves and branches",
    "Males vocalize loudly during breeding season (Nov-Feb in wild) - calls intensify after rain",
