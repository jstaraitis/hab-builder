# Habitat Builder: Project Overview

## What is Habitat Builder?

Habitat Builder is a free web application that helps reptile and amphibian keepers design proper enclosures with science-backed care parameters and equipment recommendations. Think of it as a "habitat design calculator" that takes the guesswork out of setting up an enclosure.

## The Problem We're Solving

Setting up a reptile or amphibian enclosure is **overwhelming** for beginners:

- **Conflicting information**: Forums, YouTube, and pet stores give contradictory advice
- **Equipment confusion**: UVB bulbs, heat sources, substrates—what do you actually need?
- **Size misconceptions**: "20 gallon tanks are fine for bearded dragons" (they're not)
- **Budget surprises**: People don't realize proper setups cost $300-800 until items are in their cart
- **Information overload**: Spending 10+ hours researching care guides across dozens of sources

**Result:** Many animals live in inadequate conditions, not because keepers don't care, but because they didn't know better when starting out.

## Our Solution

Habitat Builder provides **instant, customized enclosure plans** in 3 steps:

1. **Select your animal** (White's Tree Frog, Bearded Dragon, etc.)
2. **Enter enclosure dimensions** (or choose from common preset sizes)
3. **Get a complete plan** with:
   - Equipment recommendations (UVB, heating, substrate, decor)
   - Shopping list with budget tiers (low/mid/premium)
   - Quantity calculations (substrate depth, fixture sizing)
   - Step-by-step build instructions
   - Care guidance (feeding, misting, temperature zones)
   - Safety warnings and beginner tips

### What Makes It Different

- **Species-specific**: Not generic "reptile care"—tailored to each animal's needs
- **Deterministic calculations**: Equipment sizing based on enclosure volume, temperature differentials, and coverage requirements (not vague AI suggestions)
- **Budget-conscious**: Shows multiple price points so keepers can plan expenses
- **Educational**: Explains *why* certain equipment is needed
- **Completely free**: No paywalls, no accounts required (currently)

## Why I Built This

As someone who's researched reptile keeping extensively, I saw the same questions repeated endlessly in communities:

- "Is this enclosure big enough?"
- "What UVB bulb do I need?"
- "How much substrate should I buy?"
- "Can I use sand for my bearded dragon?" (No.)

**I wanted to create the resource I wish existed when I was researching setups.** A single tool that aggregates expert guidance and does the tedious calculations automatically.

This isn't just about convenience—it's about **animal welfare**. When people have clear, accurate information from day one, animals get proper care. When they piece together advice from random sources, mistakes happen.

## Current Status

### What's Live Now
✅ 2 animal profiles (White's Tree Frog, Bearded Dragon)  
✅ Complete equipment recommendation engine  
✅ Shopping list generator with budget tiers  
✅ Build instructions and care guidance  
✅ Educational blog posts (UVB, temperature, humidity, feeding, enrichment)  
✅ Dark mode and mobile-responsive design  
✅ SEO optimization for discoverability  

### What's Next (Pre-Launch)
🔄 Add 3-5 more popular species (Crested Gecko, Leopard Gecko, Ball Python)  
🔄 FAQ page for common questions  
🔄 Animal directory for browsing all available species  
🔄 Mobile testing and bug fixes  

### Future Vision
📅 3D enclosure visualizer  
📅 PDF export for offline reference  
📅 Cost estimator with real-time pricing  
📅 User accounts to save multiple designs  
📅 Community photo gallery for inspiration  
📅 50+ species profiles across reptiles and amphibians

## Who This Helps

### Primary Users
- **First-time reptile keepers** who need a clear starting point
- **Parents buying for kids** who want to "do it right"
- **Hobbyists upgrading setups** from outdated enclosures
- **Rescue organizations** standardizing care protocols

### Secondary Benefits
- **Reduces impulse purchases** (people see full costs upfront)
- **Improves animal welfare** (proper enclosures from day one)
- **Saves time** (no more 10-hour research rabbit holes)
- **Builds confidence** (users trust they're making good decisions)

## Technology & Approach

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (with dark mode)
- **Data**: JSON-based animal profiles (easy to expand)
- **Hosting**: [Your hosting platform]

### Data Sources
All care parameters come from:
- **ReptiFiles** (research-backed care guides by Jessica Archibald)
- **Equipment manufacturers** (official specs for UVB output, wattage)
- **Scientific literature** (thermal biology, habitat studies)
- **Experienced breeders** (real-world validation)

### Why Not AI-Generated?
We use **deterministic formulas**, not AI, because:
- Equipment sizing requires exact calculations (UVB coverage %, substrate volume)
- Consistency matters—same inputs always give same outputs
- Accountability—we can cite sources for every recommendation
- Trust—users know recommendations aren't "hallucinated"

## How You Can Help

### If You're a Reptile Keeper
- **Test the tool** with your current setups and provide feedback
- **Request species** you'd like to see added
- **Share with communities** (Reddit, Discord, Facebook groups)
- **Report issues** if you find incorrect care info

### If You're a Developer
- **Contribute animal profiles** (we have a template + documentation)
- **Fix bugs** or improve features (open source repo)
- **Suggest technical improvements** (performance, accessibility)

### If You're a Content Creator
- **Feature the tool** in your reptile care videos/posts
- **Link from care guides** to give viewers a planning resource
- **Collaborate** on species profiles or educational content

### If You're an Industry Expert
- **Validate care parameters** to ensure accuracy
- **Suggest equipment** that works well in practice
- **Connect us with breeders** for species-specific insights

---

## Funding & Sustainability

### Current Model
- **Completely free** for all users
- No ads, no paywalls, no data collection (beyond basic analytics)

### Future Revenue (Under Consideration)
- **Affiliate links** for recommended equipment (Amazon Associates, Chewy)
- **Premium features** (3D visualizer, saved designs, PDF export)
- **Sponsorships** from ethical reptile brands
- **Donations** from users who want to support development

**Philosophy:** Core functionality (species guides, shopping lists, care info) will **always be free**. We only monetize convenience features, never critical information.

---

## Impact Goals

### Short-Term (2026)
- Help **10,000+ keepers** design proper enclosures
- Reduce setup mistakes by giving clear guidance upfront
- Build a library of **20+ species profiles**

### Long-Term (2027+)
- Become the **go-to resource** for enclosure planning
- Partner with rescues to standardize care protocols
- Expand to **100+ species** covering all common pets
- Influence industry standards (pet stores link to our guides)

## Why This Matters

Every year, thousands of reptiles live in inadequate conditions because owners didn't know better. Pet stores sell "starter kits" that are too small. Forums give conflicting advice. Care sheets are outdated.

**Habitat Builder exists to break that cycle.**

When someone decides to get a reptile, they should have access to clear, accurate, actionable information from day one. Not after their animal develops metabolic bone disease. Not after they've wasted money on the wrong equipment. **From the start.**

This project is about **animal welfare through education**. If we can prevent even a fraction of the setup mistakes happening daily, we've made a difference.
