**Subject:** Free Reptile Setup Tool - Would Love Your Feedback

```
Hey [Name],

I built a free tool to help reptile/amphibian keepers plan proper enclosures, and I'd really appreciate your expert opinion before sharing it widely.

**How it works:** Select your animal and input dimensions → get a complete build plan with shopping lists, care parameters, and warnings about common setup mistakes (screen enclosures for amphibians, undersized tanks, wrong substrate, etc.).

**Try it here:** [YOUR-URL-HERE]

I've been keeping White's Tree Frogs and got frustrated watching beginners make the same mistakes over and over. Built this to give people accurate, species-specific guidance in one place instead of piecing together info from dozens of forum threads. It uses deterministic calculations based on proven care standards - no AI, just real research.

Would you be willing to test it for [their specialty species] and let me know if the care parameters and equipment recommendations are accurate? Should take about 10 minutes.

I'm genuinely looking for honest feedback to improve it, not just endorsements. But if you find it useful, you're absolutely welcome to share it with your audience.

Thanks for everything you do for the community!

[Your name]

P.S. Currently supports 18 species including White's Tree Frogs, Bearded Dragons, Crested Geckos, Axolotls, and more.

Hey! Really enjoy your content on [specific thing].

Quick ask - I built a free reptile enclosure planning tool and I'm looking for feedback from experienced keepers before launching it more widely.

You pick your animal → enter dimensions → get full build plan with shopping list, care targets, and warnings about common mistakes. Uses real care standards and calculations, not AI.

**Link:** [YOUR-URL-HERE]

Would you mind testing it for [their species] and letting me know if the care info is accurate? Takes about 10 min.

Looking for honest feedback, not just nice comments! No worries if you're too busy though.

Appreciate you! 🦎

**Title:** Built a free enclosure planning tool - looking for honest feedback from experienced keepers

```
Hey everyone,

I created a web app that generates custom enclosure build plans for reptiles/amphibians. You input dimensions and select a species, and it outputs equipment lists, care parameters, and warnings about common beginner mistakes.

Currently supports 18 species including White's Tree Frogs, Bearded Dragons, Crested Geckos, Leopard Geckos, Ball Pythons, Axolotls, and more.

**Link:** [YOUR-URL-HERE]

I'm looking for feedback from experienced keepers:
- Are the care parameters accurate?
- What equipment or warnings are missing?
- Is anything confusing or wrong?

Built this because I kept seeing beginners make the same mistakes (screen enclosures for tree frogs, undersized tanks, etc.). Uses deterministic calculations based on proven care standards - no AI guessing. 100% free, no ads, no accounts needed.

Appreciate any feedback!

Completely free, no signup, trying to help reduce improper setups in the hobby.

## Tips for Personalizing

### Required Replacements
- `[YOUR-URL-HERE]` - Replace with your actual Habitat Builder URL
- `[Name]` - Use their actual name (email only)
- `[their specialty species]` - Mention animals they actually work with
- `[specific thing]` - Reference real content ("your bioactive builds", "your care videos", etc.)

### Best Practices
- **For YouTube Creators:** Use email template, check About section for business email
- **For Instagram/TikTok:** Use DM template
- **For Reptile Shops/Rescues:** Use email template, mention their customers/adopters
- **For Reddit/Facebook:** Use community post templates
- **For Discord:** Use DM template in #general or #introductions channel

### Tone Guidelines
- Lead with value (what the tool does)
- Ask for honest feedback, not endorsements
- Acknowledge their expertise
- Make it clear it's free/no strings attached
- Keep under 150 words for DMs, under 200 for emails
- Specific call-to-action (test X species, takes Y minutes)

### Follow-Up Strategy
If they respond with feedback:
1. Thank them genuinely
2. Ask if they'd like to be credited in acknowledgments
3. If feedback is substantial, offer to add them to a "Reviewed by" section
4. If they share it, thank them publicly (tag them if appropriate)
