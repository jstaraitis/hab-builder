# 🎨 3D Model Creation Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the priority and strategy for creating 3D models to enhance HabBuilder's 3D visualization features. Models are categorized by priority and impact on user experience.

---

## 🔴 High Priority (Most Impactful)

### 1. Realistic Branch/Driftwood Variations (3-4 versions)
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** High - core habitat element

- **Horizontal Branch** - For low perches and resting spots
- **Angled Climbing Branch** - 30-45° angle for climbing pathways
- **Curved/Twisted Branch** - Natural realistic shapes
- **Y-Shaped/Multi-Fork Branch** - Already have one; need variations

**Why:** Core habitat element used in almost every enclosure, adds significant visual realism

---

### 2. Hide Types (3 variations)
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** High - essential for all species

- **Log Hide** - Hollow log cylinder with entrance opening
- **Coconut Cave** - Dome shaped with side entrance (natural coconut shell look)
- **Half-Dome Cave** - Simpler buried look, substrate integrated

**Why:** Essential for tree frogs, geckos, and other arboreal species. Directly impacts visual design accuracy

---

### 3. Water Bowl/Dish (2 variations)
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Medium-High - daily necessity

- **Shallow Water Dish** - Current procedural version (improve texture/materials)
- **Larger Water Bowl** - With depth, more realistic
- **Ceramic/Stone Texture** - Realistic material appearance

**Why:** Daily necessity in all setups, visible in most layouts, users expect to see it

---

### 4. Lighting Fixtures (2 variations)
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Medium-High - safety-critical equipment

- **T8/T10 Linear UVB Fixture** - Rectangular hood with reflector, bulb visible
- **Heat Lamp Fixture** - Dome reflector with bulb mount
- **Ceramic Heat Emitter** - For alternative heating

**Why:** Safety-critical equipment, positioned at top of enclosure, users need to visualize placement

---

### 5. Climbing Structures (2-3 versions)
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Medium-High - arboreal species essential

- **Vertical Climbing Frame/Grid** - Mesh or bar grid for climbing
- **Diagonal Climbing Rod** - Cross-brace climbing aid
- **Mesh/Screen Panel** - For walls, vertical climbing surface

**Why:** Critical for arboreal species (tree frogs, geckos), high visual impact

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### 6. Cork Bark Pieces (2-3 pieces)
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Medium - common decor element

- **Curved Cork Bark Slab** - Natural curved piece
- **Cork Bark Tube/Roll** - Vertical hiding spot
- **Flat Cork Panel** - Wall mounting option

**Why:** Common decor material, good hiding spots, realistic natural aesthetic

---

### 7. Live Plants (3-4 potted varieties)
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Medium - bioactive setups

- **Pothos Vine in Pot** - Trailing vine plant
- **Fern Plant** - Delicate fronds
- **Bromeliad** - Stiff leaves, tank bromeliad
- **Moss Pole** - Pole with moss covering

**Why:** Bioactive setups, high aesthetic importance, users want realistic vegetation visualization

---

### 8. Substrate Base Layer
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Medium - visual foundation

- **Realistic Substrate Pile** - Textured substrate with depth
- **Various Substrate Types** - Coco husk, organic mix, sphagnum variations

**Why:** Visual foundation of entire design, important for professional appearance

---

### 9. Humidifier/Fogger
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Low-Medium - specialty equipment

- **Ultrasonic Mister** - Small handheld or mounted device
- **Fogger Unit** - Larger fogging system

**Why:** Common in tropical setups, helps visualize humidity control equipment

---

## 🟢 Nice to Have (Lower Priority)

### 10. Feeding Dishes (1-2)
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Low - optional but nice

- **Small Feeding Bowl** - Ceramic or plastic
- **Cricket/Feeder Dish** - Escape-proof feeder

**Why:** Completion-focused, less critical but improves overall realism

---

### 11. Driftwood Pieces (2-3 sizes)
**Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Low-Medium - natural decoration

- **Small Piece** - 6-12" length
- **Medium Piece** - 12-24" length
- **Large Piece** - 24"+ statement piece

**Why:** Natural decoration alternative to branches

---

### 12. Decorative Rocks (2-3)
**Priority:** ⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Low - terrestrial focus

- **Small Pebbles/Gravel Pile** - Ground scatter
- **Medium Rock Formations** - Basking rocks
- **Large Statement Rock** - Feature piece

**Why:** More relevant for terrestrial species (leopard geckos, bearded dragons)

---

### 13. Thermometer/Hygrometer Display
**Priority:** ⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Low - optional equipment

- **Digital Display Unit** - Modern look
- **Analog Gauge** - Traditional gauge style

**Why:** Equipment visibility, less critical for main design

---

### 14. Equipment Supports/Stands
**Priority:** ⭐⭐  
**Estimated Impact:** Low - mounting details

- **Heat Lamp Stand** - Tripod or clamp mount
- **Light Fixture Mounting Bracket** - Ceiling mount system

**Why:** How equipment attaches to enclosure, detail-oriented

---

   - Highest ROI - used in most builds
   - Can be created from one base model with modifications
   
2. ✅ **Hide Types** (log, cave, dome)
   - Essential for tree frogs/geckos
   - High visual impact
   
3. ✅ **Water Dish** (improve existing procedural)

4. ✅ **UVB Light Fixture**
   - Safety-critical visualization
   - Commonly requested

## 📞 Questions & Notes

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- Should models be photorealistic or stylized?
- Do we want animated components (fans, misters)?
- Should models have breakable/removable parts?
- Do we need size variants (small/medium/large)?

**Implementation Notes:**
- Models auto-offset vertically to prevent overlap
- Users can drag/reposition any model
- Camera can orbit for 360° view
- Models stored in `public/models/` directory
