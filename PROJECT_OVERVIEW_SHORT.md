Hey! Just reaching out because I built something I think might be helpful for the reptile/amphibian community. Quick overview below:

---

  What It Is
A free web app that builds custom enclosure plans for reptiles and amphibians. Pick your animal, enter tank dimensions, get a shopping list, equipment specs, and build steps. It's also a one-stop resource for ongoing care—feeding schedules, misting routines, temperature ranges, and more.

  The Problem 
New keepers get conflicting advice from forums, YouTube, and pet stores. Equipment sizing is confusing (UVB coverage, substrate depth, heat wattage). Proper setups cost $300-800, which blindsides people. Animals end up in bad enclosures because of misinformation.



  The Solution
Enter your animal and tank dimensions, get a plan with:
- Equipment recommendations with budget options
- Shopping lists with automatic quantity calculations
- Step-by-step build instructions
- Care tips and safety warnings

Uses formulas based on research, not AI.



  Current Status
**Right now:** 2 animal profiles, equipment engine, blog posts  
**Soon:** 3-5 more species, FAQ page, mobile improvements  
**Eventually:** 3D visualizer, PDF export, cost estimates, 50+ species



  Who It's For
First-time keepers, parents, hobbyists upgrading setups, rescues needing care standards.



  Why I Built This
I've loved frogs since I was a kid. When I finally got my five White's tree frogs, finding reliable info was a nightmare—scattered across forums, YouTube, Reddit, care sheets. As a software developer, I thought: why isn't there one place with clear answers?

**Background:** Software developer, frog enthusiast, hobbyist.



  Why It Matters
Many reptiles end up in inadequate setups because owners didn't have good information. This tool provides accurate guidance upfront.



  Why I'm Reaching Out
I've been following your content for a while, and you're someone the community trusts for solid, accurate care advice. I'm not trying to sell anything—just wanted to share what I built and see if it might be useful to the people you help. If you think it's worth sharing or have feedback, I'd appreciate it.
