## Equipment Category Analysis

### Enclosures (Most Critical Price Point)
**Finding**: User feedback of $170 for 18×18×24 glass is accurate
- Previous catalog: $38-113 (drastically underestimated)
- Market reality: $170-450 depending on quality
- Impact: Most beginner setups budgeted $200-300 for enclosure alone

### Heating Systems (Complex Pricing Structure)

### Lighting (Underestimated in Original Pricing)
**Finding**: Quality UVB fixtures cost $35-140+ depending on brand
- Basic: $35-75 (single bulb)
- Premium: $76-170 (Arcadia kits with reflectors)
- Impact: Total lighting investment is significant part of setup cost

### Aquatic Equipment (Specialized High-Cost Segment)
**Finding**: Aquatic setups are 2-3x more expensive than terrestrial
- Chillers: $150-600 (essential for axolotls)
- Canister filters: $45-225

## Substrate Pricing Per-Unit Strategy

### Why Per-Unit Pricing?
**Problem**: Fixed price ranges don't scale with quantity
- 10 quarts vs 50 quarts should have very different costs
- Old system: Showed same price regardless of substrate volume

**Solution**: Per-unit pricing allows accurate calculations
- 10 quarts × $0.85/quart = $8.50
- 50 quarts × $0.85/quart = $42.50
- Calculation is transparent and adjusts with enclosure size

### Market Research for Substrate Pricing
| Substrate | Min/quart | Max/quart | Source |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Aspen Shavings | $0.45 | $0.75 | Bulk pricing analysis |
| Cypress Mulch | $0.65 | $1.15 | Zoo Med standard |
| Cocohusk | $0.55 | $1.05 | ReptiFiles verified |
| Sphagnum Moss | $0.65 | $1.25 | Specialty botanical |
| Coco Loco | $1.00 | $1.50 | Premium blend |
| Zoo Med Eco Earth | $0.95 | $1.50 | Brand premium |

**Verification**: 
- Minimum tier: Budget bulk options
- Recommended: Standard quality, good value
- Ideal: Premium bioactive mixes
