⚡ UTILITY TAGS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[] (empty array)
  Purpose: No specific trigger tags needed
  Triggers: Equipment always shown or conditionally shown by other logic
  Used by: Universal equipment
  Example equipment: Basic monitoring, thermometers, general tools

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📋 HOW THE TAG SYSTEM WORKS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. ANIMAL PROFILES ASSIGN TAGS
   Animal profiles in data/animals/*.json assign tags based on care requirements
   Example: Bearded Dragon might have:
   ["heatSource:basking", "lighting:uvb-desert", "humidity:low"]

2. EQUIPMENT DECLARES NEEDED TAGS
   Equipment in data/equipment/*.json declares which tags it needs
   Example: UVB Desert fixture has:
   needsTags: ["lighting:uvb-desert"]

3. SHOPPING LIST GENERATOR MATCHES THEM
   If animal has tag → Include equipment with that tag
   If animal has "lighting:uvb-desert" → Include UVB Desert fixture

4. MULTIPLE TAGS = OR LOGIC
   Equipment included if ANY tag matches
   Example: Misting system → needsTags: ["humidity:high", "humidity:moderate"]
   Included if animal needs high OR moderate humidity

5. EMPTY ARRAY = UNIVERSAL EQUIPMENT
   Example: Thermometer/hygrometer → needsTags: []
   Always included regardless of species

💡 BEST PRACTICES FOR ADDING EQUIPMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✓ BE SPECIFIC WITH TAGS
  Don't use ["heating"], use ["heating:aquatic"] or ["heatSource:basking"]

✓ USE MULTIPLE TAGS FOR FLEXIBILITY
  Equipment that works for multiple scenarios should list all applicable tags

✓ EMPTY TAGS = ALWAYS SHOWN
  Only use [] for truly universal equipment (monitoring, general tools)

✓ TAGS MIRROR NATURAL REQUIREMENTS
  Tag structure follows how keepers think about care requirements

✓ CONSISTENCY IS KEY
  Use existing tags when possible, only create new tags when necessary

✓ DOCUMENT NEW TAGS
  Add new tags to this reference when creating them
